Use Apache Kafka to stream the scraped data to a processing engine.
Process and clean the data using Apache Spark.
Store the processed data in a relational database or data warehouse like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or AWS Redshift.
Optionally, create a dashboard to visualize the data using Tableau or Power BI.
2. Real-Time Data Pipeline for IoT Sensor Data
Objective: Create a real-time data pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze IoT sensor data.
Tools: MQTT (for IoT data ingestion), Apache Kafka (for streaming), Apache Flink or Spark Streaming (for processing), AWS Kinesis, AWS Lambda (for serverless processing), and AWS DynamoDB or Time Series Database (for storage).
Steps:
Simulate IoT sensor data using a tool like MQTT or generate it using a Python script.
Stream the data to Kafka or AWS Kinesis.
Process the data in real-time using Apache Flink or AWS Lambda.
Store the processed data in a time-series database like InfluxDB or AWS DynamoDB.
Set up real-time monitoring and alerts using Grafana.
3. Batch Data Processing Pipeline for Financial Data
Objective: Develop a batch processing pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes financial data (e.g., stock prices, cryptocurrency data).
Tools: Python, Apache Airflow (for orchestration), Apache Spark (for processing), AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage (for storage), Redshift/BigQuery (for analysis).
Steps:
Collect historical financial data from APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
Use Apache Airflow to schedule and orchestrate the data ingestion process.
Process and clean the data using Apache Spark.
Store the cleaned data in a data lake (AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
Load the data into a data warehouse like Redshift or BigQuery for analysis.
Optionally, build a dashboard to track stock prices or other financial metrics.
4. ETL Pipeline for E-commerce Data
Objective: Build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process data from an e-commerce platform (e.g., product data, sales data).
Tools: Apache NiFi (for ETL), AWS Glue (for transformation), Snowflake (for data warehousing), Python (for custom scripts).
Steps:
Extract data from an e-commerce platform (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce) using APIs or direct database connections.
Use Apache NiFi to automate the ETL process.
Transform the data using AWS Glue or custom Python scripts.
Load the transformed data into a data warehouse like Snowflake.
Create reports or dashboards to analyze sales trends, product performance, etc.
5. Social Media Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
Objective: Create a pipeline that collects social media data (e.g., tweets), analyzes sentiment, and stores the results for reporting.
Tools: Twitter API, Apache Kafka (for streaming), Apache Spark (for real-time processing), Elasticsearch (for storage), Kibana (for visualization).
Steps:
Use the Twitter API to collect tweets related to specific keywords or hashtags.
Stream the tweets to Apache Kafka.
Use Apache Spark to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets in real-time.
Store the analyzed data in Elasticsearch.
Visualize the sentiment trends using Kibana.
6. Data Pipeline for Log Processing and Analysis
Objective: Build a pipeline to collect, process, and analyze server logs or application logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
Tools: Fluentd/Logstash (for log collection), Apache Kafka (for streaming), Apache Flink or Spark (for processing), Elasticsearch (for storage), Grafana/Kibana (for visualization).
Steps:
Collect logs from servers or applications using Fluentd or Logstash.
Stream the logs to Apache Kafka.
Process and analyze the logs in real-time using Apache Flink or Spark.
Store the processed logs in Elasticsearch.
Set up Grafana or Kibana to visualize log patterns and detect anomalies.
7. Data Integration and Transformation Pipeline
Objective: Integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., CRM, ERP, marketing platforms), transform it, and load it into a centralized data warehouse.
Tools: Fivetran/Stitch (for data integration), dbt (for transformation), Google BigQuery/Snowflake (for warehousing), Tableau/Looker (for visualization).
Steps:
Use Fivetran or Stitch to extract data from various sources and load it into a raw data warehouse table.
Transform the data using dbt, applying business logic to clean and organize the data.
Store the transformed data in a centralized data warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake.
Create reports and dashboards using Tableau or Looker.
8. Data Pipeline for COVID-19 Data Analysis
Objective: Build a data pipeline to collect, process, and analyze COVID-19 data from public APIs, track trends, and predict outcomes.
Tools: Python, Apache Airflow (for orchestration), Apache Spark (for processing), AWS S3 (for storage), Tableau (for visualization).
Steps:
Collect COVID-19 data from public APIs (e.g., Johns Hopkins University, WHO).
Use Apache Airflow to schedule regular data ingestion and processing tasks.
Process and clean the data using Apache Spark.
Store the processed data in AWS S3.
Create a dashboard in Tableau to track and visualize COVID-19 trends.
9. Building a Recommendation System Pipeline
Objective: Develop a data pipeline that collects user interaction data, processes it, and generates personalized recommendations.
Tools: Apache Kafka (for streaming), Apache Spark (for data processing and ML model training), Redis (for caching recommendations), Elasticsearch (for indexing).
Steps:
Collect user interaction data (e.g., clicks, views, purchases) from a web or mobile application.
Stream the data to Apache Kafka.
Use Apache Spark to process the data and train recommendation models.
Cache the recommendations in Redis for fast retrieval.
Store and index user and product data in Elasticsearch to support personalized recommendations.
10. Automated Data Quality Pipeline
Objective: Create a pipeline that automatically validates and monitors data quality as it flows through different stages.
Tools: Great Expectations (for data validation), Apache Airflow (for orchestration), AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage (for storage), Slack/Email (for alerts).
Steps:
Set up data validation rules using Great Expectations.
Integrate Great Expectations with Apache Airflow to run validation checks during each stage of the pipeline.
Store validated data in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
Configure alerts via Slack or email to notify you of any data quality issues.
